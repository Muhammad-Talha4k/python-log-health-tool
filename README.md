# Advanced Git & GitHub Assignment – Log Health Tool

A Python-based **Log Analysis & Data Health Tool** demonstrating advanced Git workflows including branch isolation, stashing, hotfixes, and controlled merging.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project implements a practical tool that:

-   **Reads** application logs from CSV files
-   **Analyzes** log data with multiple health checks
-   **Displays** clear console summaries

The codebase demonstrates professional Git practices including feature branches, hotfixes, Git stash for task interruption, and clean merge workflows.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By working through this project, you will learn:

-   **Branch Isolation** : How feature branches prevent changes from affecting main
-   **Git Stash** : Safely save incomplete work when switching tasks
-   **Hotfix Workflow** : Handle urgent fixes on main without disrupting features
-   **Controlled Merging** : Integrate features cleanly with proper commit history
-   **Safe Task Switching** : Professional patterns used in real software teams

## 📁 Project Structure

```

## ✨ Features

### Phase 1: Base Tool Setup

-   Load CSV application logs
-   Display total log record count
-   Proper project structure and small commits

### Phase 2: Error Logging Summary (Feature Branch)

-   Main branch remains unaffected until merge

### Phase 3: Git Stash – Simulated Interruption

-   Start time-based grouping feature (incomplete)
-   Stash work using`git stash`
-   Switch to`hotfix-log-loader` branch for urgent fixes
-   Fix CSV empty file handling

### Phase 4: Stashed Work Recovery

-   Apply stashed changes with`git stash apply`
-   Complete time-based log grouping feature
-   Merge into main with clean history
-   Verify no code loss

## 📚 Git Workflow Explanation

### Why Git Stash Was Needed

In real-world development, you often face this scenario:

-   You're working on a feature branch with uncommitted changes
-   An urgent production bug needs fixing NOW
-   You can't commit incomplete work to the feature branch
-   Solution:**Git Stash** temporarily saves your work

### When Git Stash Was Applied

**Phase 3 Scenario:**

1.  Working on`feature-error-summary` branch
2.  Started implementing time-based log grouping (incomplete)
3.  Urgent hotfix needed → Stashed changes
4.  Switched to`hotfix-log-loader` branch for emergency fix
5.  Fixed bug in`loader.py` for empty CSV handling
6.  Returned to feature branch and restored stashed work

### Branch History

```
main                          ← Production code├── feature-error-summary     ← Feature development│   ├── Add error counting│   ├── [STASHED: time grouping]│   └── Complete time grouping (restored from stash)└── hotfix-log-loader         ← Emergency fix    └── Fix empty CSV handling
```

### Proof of Branch Isolation

Before merging `feature-error-summary`:

-   **Main branch** ran without error-level summaries ✓
-   Feature changes existed ONLY on feature branch ✓
-   Main branch remained unaffected ✓

After merging:

-   Main now includes all feature functionality ✓
-   Clean, linear merge history ✓

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### src/loader.py

-   Loads CSV application logs
-   Handles empty files gracefully (hotfix)
-   Returns list of log records

### src/analyzer.py

-   Counts log levels (ERROR, WARNING, INFO)
-   Groups logs by time periods
-   Formats console output
-   Produces readable summaries

## 📊 Commit History Pattern

This project demonstrates proper Git practices:

```
commit abc1234: Add project structure and base setupcommit def5678: Implement CSV loader with basic outputcommit ghi9012: [feature-error-summary] Add log level countingcommit jkl3456: [hotfix-log-loader] Handle empty CSV filescommit mno7890: Merge hotfix into maincommit pqr1234: [feature-error-summary] Add time-based groupingcommit stu5678: Merge feature-error-summary into main
```

Notice:

-   Small, focused commits
-   Clear commit messages
-   Feature work isolated on branches
-   Hotfix applied separately
-   Clean merges at the end

## 🧪 Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing

1.  **Test CSV Loading:**
    
    ```bash
    python -c "from src.loader import load_logs; print(load_logs('data/app_logs.csv'))"
    ```
    
2.  **Test Error Analysis:**
    
    ```bash
    python -c "from src.analyzer import analyze; analyze('data/app_logs.csv')"
    ```
    

### Edge Cases to Handle

-   Empty CSV files
-   Missing log level column
-   Malformed timestamp entries
-   Very large log files

## 🔑 Key Git Commands Used

This project demonstrates these essential commands:

```bash
# Create and switch to feature branchgit checkout -b feature-error-summary# Save incomplete workgit stash# List stashed workgit stash list# Apply stashed changesgit stash apply# Create hotfix branchgit checkout -b hotfix-log-loader# Merge branchesgit merge feature-error-summarygit merge hotfix-log-loader
```

## 📖 Repository Information

-   **Repository Type:** Public/Learning
-   **Primary Language:** Python
-   **Git Workflow:** Feature branch + Hotfix pattern
-   **No External Dependencies:** Pure Python implementation

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Why use Git Stash instead of committing incomplete work?**A: Git Stash keeps your commit history clean. You don't want half-finished features in the log. Stash is perfect for temporary context switches.

**Q: Can the feature branch affect main if it's not merged?**A: No. Feature branches are completely isolated. Changes exist only on that branch until you explicitly merge.

**Q: What happens if I accidentally delete stashed work?**A: You can recover it! Git keeps stash history. Use `git stash list` to see all stashes. Dropped stashes remain in the git reflog for ~30 days.

**Q: How is the hotfix different from a feature?**A: Hotfixes branch from main (not develop), fix critical bugs, and merge back immediately. Features are longer-running and get more thorough testing.

## 🎓 Real-World Applications

This workflow pattern is used in:

-   **Agile Teams** : Sprint-based development with emergency hotfixes
-   **DevOps Pipelines** : Feature branches integrate with CI/CD
-   **Open Source** : PRs follow this isolated-branch pattern
-   **Enterprise** : Controlled releases from main branch only

## 📝 Notes for Developers

-   Keep commits small and focused
-   Write meaningful commit messages
-   Always test before merging
-   Use descriptive branch names
-   Clean up merged branches after integration
